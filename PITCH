The Latino Health Paradox refers to the observed differences in life expectancies and health outcomes, noting that Hispanics tend to have equal or even better health outcomes compared to non-Hispanic Whites across various health measures. Using Fernandez’s 2023 article from the Journal of Economic Perspectives as a starting point I observed that there is significant research suggesting the salmon bias and the healthy immigrant effect are contributors to this phenomena. The salmon bias suggests that “Latinos engage in return migration to their country of origin and are thereby rendered ‘statistically immortal’” (Abraído-Lanza, 1999). Meanwhile the health immigrant effect suggests that Latino immigrants are a self selecting group and only the healthiest will migrate to the U.S. Taking this information on what has been already researched I developed the researched: Compared to other immigrant groups how do Latinos compare? Currently the research considers Latinos as a monolithic racial category, whereas this approach will allow for country by country comparison between Latin American immigrants and other immigrant groups.
