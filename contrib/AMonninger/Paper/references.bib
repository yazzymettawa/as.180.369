               indirect taxes, both the liability regressivity and the reverse
               redistributive effect have been enhanced. We use recently
               developed statistical tests to gauge the significance of the

               Italy granted to banks (and other firms) that increase their
               equity from a base year. Using a difference‐in‐differences
               setting, we observe an 8.83\% increase in bank capital ratios
               following the implementation of this reform. When this tax
               mechanism is phased out, we observe an opposite effect on the
               equity ratio, showing the absence of a hysteresis effect in bank
               capital. We document a heterogeneous effect for large and small

               probably higher now than it was in the early 1980s. This suggests
               that the Tax Reform Act achieved little, if any, simplification
               in the tax system, although it remains possible that the Act
               dampened what would have been an even greater increase in

               legislation enacted since the income tax was converted to a mass
               tax during World War II. After decades of erosion, the individual
               and corporate income tax bases were broadened and the revenues
               were used to reduce tax rates. Loopholes and preferences that
               were formerly considered sacrosanct were eliminated or moderated
               despite the determined opposition of powerful pressure groups.
               Comprehensive income taxation, which had earlier been regarded as
               an impossible dream, carried the day with strong bipartisan
               support. I will trace the origins of the tax reform movement and
               speculate about why it was successful in 1986 after repeated
               failures in earlier years. I also explain what the 1986 act
               accomplished and what more needs to be done to achieve the

               government budget, economic activity, and distribution of
               resources. Based on evidence through 2019, we find that the TCJA

               disproportionately increasing incomes for the most affluent. Its
               effects on GDP and median wages seem modest at best, although
               clear counterfactuals are difficult to identify. The impact on
               investment is less certain, and research is only recently
               emerging that addresses this question. Empirical analysis of
               longer-term effects may prove difficult due to the disruptions
