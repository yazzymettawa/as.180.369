ABSTRACT:

This paper examines how labor force participation rates in the United States, from 1920 to 2020, vary according to political party governance at the state level. It extrapolates broader political and social factors by analyzing provisions of social welfare programs, legislation promoting educational attainment, and policies encouraging family planning. Using the Difference-in-Differences method, the rate of change in two-year periods will be analyzed in relation to the political party of the governor, with Republican control as the treatment group and Democratic control as the control group, comparing these rates between states. Statistically significant discrepancies in the rate of change between states will then be examined for their association with changes in social welfare programs, education policy, and family planning legislation. The results indicate that Democratic leadership correlates with increases in social welfare spending and educational attainment, which, correlates with higher labor force participation.
