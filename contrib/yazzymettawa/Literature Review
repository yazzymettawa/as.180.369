The Rise in the Disability Rolls and the Decline in Unemployment
Author: David Autor, M. Duggan

ABSTRACT: "Between 1984 and 2001, the share of nonelderly adults receiving Social Security Disability Insurance income (DI) rose by 60 percent to 5.3 million beneficiaries. Rapid program growth despite improving aggregate health appears to be explained by reduced screening stringency, declining demand for less skilled workers, and an unforeseen increase in the earnings replacement rate. We estimate that the sum of these forces doubled the labor force exit propensity of displaced high school dropouts after 1984, lowering measured U. S. unemployment by one-half a percentage point. Steady state calculations augur a further 40 percent increase in the rate of DI receipt."

Suggests that Disability Insurance, when coinciding with a reduction in need for low skilled labor, results in a decrease in unemployment rates. 

Key Information from article of use: "Between 1984 and 1999, the labor force participation rate of high school dropout males declined by 8.7 percentage points among those 40–54, and 7 percentage points among those 55–64. Simultaneously, the share of male high school dropouts in these age brackets receiving DI rose by 5.3 and 6.3 percentage points. Hence, despite the steep decline in male high school dropout participation, the share of male high school dropout nonparticipants receiving DI benefits in these age categories rose to slightly above 40 percent."

Changes in Labor Force Participation in the United States
Author: Chinhui Juhn and Simon Potter

ABSTRACT: "The labor force participation rate in the United States increased almost continuously for two-and-a-half decades after the mid-1960s, pausing only briefly during economic downturns. The pace of growth slowed considerably during the 1990s, however, and after reaching a record high of 67.3 percent in the first quarter of 2000, participation had declined by 1.5 percentage points by 2005. This paper reviews the social and demographic trends that contributed to the movements in the labor force participation rate in the second half of the twentieth century. It also examines the manner in which developments in the 2000s reflect a break from past trends and considers implications for the future."

Key Information from article of use: "The labor force participation rate of married women seems unlikely to rise much above the levels seen in the late 1990s. Future labor force growth for women depends on initiatives by the government or the private sector, a conclusion also reached by Ellwood (2001). Low-income single mothers may continue to enter the labor force in greater numbers with expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit. Employer-initiated programs allowing more flexible work arrangement may arise as firms compete to attract working mothers and older workers. Reductions in disability benefits may stem the withdrawal of low-skilled men from the labor market. Changes in benefit rules for Social Security may encourage delayed retire- ment of older workers. But even after noting the possibility of these changes, the decades of strongly rising labor force participation rates for the U.S. economy appear to have drawn to an end."

The Decline in Male Labor Force Participation
PARSONS (1980)

ABSTRACT: The rate of nonparticipation in market work among prime-aged males in the United States has risen persistently during the postwar period. The rate among males aged 45-54, for example, has risen from 4.2 percent to 8.4 percent from 1948 to 1976, with similar trends among other age groups. The principal hypothesis explored is that labor force withdrawal has been induced by the rapid expansion of welfare alternatives to work, principally the Social Security disability program. Cross-sectional evidence strongly confirms this hypothesis. Time-series projections of the cross-sectional model, moreover, track actual postwar trends in male labor force participation reasonably well.

Labor Supply and Marital Separation
William R. Johnson, Jonathan Skinner

Panel data are used to estimate the effect of marital separation on labor supply. Female labor supply increases substantially and male labor supply declines marginally, lending support to the theory of specialization within the household. The most interesting finding is that women began to increase their labor supply well before the actualsplit occurs, suggesting either that shocks to labor supply change divorce probabilities or that women with a higher likelihood of divorcework more. This argument is pursued by constructing and estimating a simultaneous model of labor supply and divorce risk. Copyright 1986 by American Economic Association.

Trends in the Well-Being of American Women, 1970-1995
Francine D. Blau

This paper examines the trends in the well-being of American women over the last 25 years, a time of significant changes in the relative economic status of women and in the labor market as a whole. A broad range of indicators are considered to capture changes in women's well-being in the family as well as in the labor market. For virtually all age and education groups, substantial evidence is obtained of rising gender equality in labor market outcomes, notably labor force participation, wages, and occupational distributions. Broad evidence is also found of greater gender parity within married couple families as the housework time of husbands increased relative to wives' and the relative wages of wives rose compared to their husbands'. However, parallel to the recent evidence of the declining labor market position of lower skilled men, there has been a similar deterioration in the economic status of less educated women, especially high school dropouts. Their labor force participation rates and wages have risen at a much slower pace than those of more highly educated women, while their incidence of single headship has increased much more rapidly. These findings for less educated women serve to underscore the widening gap between more and less skilled Americans of both sexes, as well as to emphasize its broad dimensions.

Changes in the Labor Supply Behavior of Married Women: 1980–2000
Francine D. Blau, Lawrence M. Kahn

Using March Current Population Survey data, we investigate married women’s labor supply from 1980 to 2000. We find a large rightward shift in their labor supply function for annual hours in the 1980s, with little shift in the 1990s. These shifts account for most of the slowdown in the growth of labor supply during this period. A major development was the dramatic decrease in the responsiveness of married women’s labor supply to their own and husbands’ wages: their own wage elasticity fell by 50%–56%, while their cross wage elasticity fell by 38%–47% in absolute value.

Where Have All the Workers Gone?: An Inquiry into the Decline of the U.S. Labor Force Participation Rate
A. Krueger, 2018

The U.S. labor force participation rate has declined since 2007, primarily because of population aging and ongoing trends that preceded the Great Recession. The labor force participation rate has evolved differently, and for different reasons, across demographic groups. A rise in school enrollment has largely offset declining labor force participation for young workers since the 1990s. Labor force participation has been declining for prime age men for decades, and about half of prime age men who are not in the labor force may have a serious health condition that is a barrier to working. Nearly half of prime age men who are not in the labor force take pain medication on any given day; and in nearly two-thirds of these cases, they take prescription pain medication. Labor force participation has fallen more in U.S. counties where relatively more opioid pain medication is prescribed, causing the problem of depressed labor force participation and the opioid crisis to become intertwined. The labor force participation rate has stopped rising for cohorts of women born after 1960. Prime age men who are out of the labor force report that they experience notably low levels of emotional well-being throughout their days, and that they derive relatively little meaning from their daily activities. Employed women and women not in the labor force, by contrast, report similar levels of subjective well-being; but women not in the labor force who cite a reason other than "home responsibilities" as their main reason report notably low levels of emotional well-being. During the past decade, retirements have increased by about the same amount as aggregate labor force participation has declined, and the retirement rate is expected to continue to rise. A meaningful rise in labor force participation will require a reversal in the secular trends affecting various demographic groups, and perhaps immigration reform.
