    "This paper explores how labor force participation rates in the United States from 1953 to 2020 are influenced by political party governance at the state and national level. Using a Weighted Least Squared (WLS) regression, the study analyzes changes in labor force participation, comparing states with Republican governors (treatment group) to those with Democratic governors (control group), as well as an Ordinary Least Squared (OLS) regression analyzing changes in labor force participation against the political party of the president, either Republican (treatment group) or Democratic (control group). The findings suggest that on both the national and state level political party leadership does not correlate with increased labor force participation. Therefore, it can not be concluded that there exists a direct relationship. \n"

    "Four factors and their relationship to labor force participation rates were frequently brought up in the literature. The contribution to labor force participation rates that will be examined are: \n",
    "-health\n",
    "-social welfare programs\n",
    "-educational policies\n",
    "-family planning initiatives\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, several studies suggest there is a relationship between provisions of childcare by the state as it frees up the time for the mother and the entry of women into the labor force. Meanwhile, disability insurance and social security provisions have been suggested to de-incentivize entry into the labor force. Dependent upon the type of welfare will impact the affect on the labor force participation rate, however since childcare provisions aren’t common in the U.S. democratic policies providing welfare will likely lead to lower labor force participation. Notably however, it is difficult to isolate any individual factor without the consideration of age."

    "In this paper, the question of how the labor force participation rate from 1953 until 2020 in the United States varied with political party governance was explored. The findings are that both the state level, as determined by the governor's political party affiliation, and the national level, as determined by the president's political party affiliation, had no statistically significant correlation with the labor force participation rate of the state or country. Further research into other branches of government and political affiliations, both local and in the House of Representatives can be used to further describe the existence or non-existence of a relationship. Some limitations include the limited time scope due to data constraints, as well as the lack of statistical accounting for economic and social factors affecting labor force participation rates outside of preliminary research. In terms of broader implications, specific policies, and their effects would need to be observed as opposed to the general policies of each political party to determine their effectiveness. "
