               primarily because of population aging and ongoing trends that
               preceded the Great Recession. The labor force participation rate
               has evolved differently, and for different reasons, across
               demographic groups. A rise in school enrollment has largely
               offset declining labor force participation for young workers
               since the 1990s. Labor force participation has been declining for
               prime age men for decades, and about half of prime age men who
               are not in the labor force may have a serious health condition
               that is a barrier to working. Nearly half of prime age men who
               are not in the labor force take pain medication on any given day;
               and in nearly two-thirds of these cases, they take prescription
               pain medication. Labor force participation has fallen more in
               U.S. counties where relatively more opioid pain medication is
               prescribed, causing the problem of depressed labor force
               participation and the opioid crisis to become intertwined. The
               labor force participation rate has stopped rising for cohorts of
               women born after 1960. Prime age men who are out of the labor
               force report that they experience notably low levels of emotional
               well-being throughout their days, and that they derive relatively
               little meaning from their daily activities. Employed women and
               women not in the labor force, by contrast, report similar levels
               of subjective well-being; but women not in the labor force who
               cite a reason other than ``home responsibilities'' as their main
               reason report notably low levels of emotional well-being. During
               the past decade, retirements have increased by about the same
               amount as aggregate labor force participation has.",

               Participation at Older Ages?",
  author    = "Burtless, Gary",
  publisher = "Center for Retirement Research",
  abstract  = "The labor force participation of men age 60-74 has increased in
               recent years. Since reaching a post-World War-II low point in
               1993, the share of such older men either working or looking for
               work jumped about 11 percentage points, from 33 percent in 1993
               to 44 percent in 2010. The increase came at a time when changes
               in the retirement income system provided incentives for career
               workers to remain in the labor force longer. The share of
               earnings that Social Security replaced at any given age was
               falling due to the rise in the program’s Full Retirement Age.
               Workers could partly or fully offset the decline by retiring
               later. Workers were also becoming increasingly dependent on
               401(k)s for their workplace retirement savings. Unlike
               traditional (defined-benefit) pension plans, 401(k) plans do not
               offer strong financial incentives to retire earlier rather than
               later. Working longer provides more time to save and earn
               investment income and shortens the time in retirement that must
               be financed with 401(k) savings. The rise in labor force
               participation can thus be seen as a response to changes in the
               retirement income system that reduce benefits available at any
               given age and reward working longer. The question addressed in
               this brief is the extent to which the increased educational
               attainment of older men helps explain their increased
               participation in the labor force.Educational attainment is a key
               determinant of worker productivity. Better educated workers are
               paid more and have more employment opportunities. At older ages
               they also tend to have better health. An increase in the
               educational attainment of older men can thus be expected to
               increase the willingness and ability of older men to work longer.
               The discussion proceeds as follows. The first section presents
               data on the rising educational attainment of older men and the
               closing of the educational gap between older and prime-age men.
               The second section examines the wages earned by older and younger
               workers to see whether these educational gains made older men
               more attractive to employers. The third section reports the
               results of an analysis assessing the extent to which the rise in
               educational attainment can explain the rise in participation. The
               final section concludes that the rise in educational attainment
               is a significant factor that makes older men more willing and
               able to remain in the labor force. But the gains in older men’s
               schooling attainment, both absolutely and relative to attainment
               of younger workers, are slowing. Therefore, the gains we have
               seen in labor force participation among older men will probably
               slow in the near future.",
