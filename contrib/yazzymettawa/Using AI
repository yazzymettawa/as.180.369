The Korinek article offered quite a few helpful ways to improve my writing with generative AI:

For one, coming up with counterarguments was one suggestion and I believe that is a good method of ensuring the logical reasoning of my work, as well as to acknowledge the counterargumemts whether they bear weight or not. Another suggestion was to ask generative AI to explain code as well as debug it. I've tried using ChatGPT to debug my code before by showing them the code and the syntax error to varying results, however asking it to explain the code may be a better method, especially if it is generated from an outside source or from generative AI itself. Utilizing this tool will mean that I won't necessarily need to start from scratch when writing a program if I'm able to successfully use the work of others. 

As for more writing techniques, the prompts for re-writing listed in the article were helpful. I find it better to provide generative AI with small samples of my writing when it comes to editing that way there's less of a chance it will misconstrue my points in a rewrite. Some warnings as far as more literary issues come to sourcing and the issue of "hallucinating" literary sources. This is a good warning to keep in mind. 

The article also mentioned that Claude has the capability to look at attachments and summarize them. Perhaps ChatGPT does as well at the paid level. But finding a tool that does have this resource, ideally for free, but perhaps its worth investing in, will be significantly useful when it comes to summarizing literature.
