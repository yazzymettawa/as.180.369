The article reiterates the same thesis that "counterfeit people" are a major threat several times but doesn’t explain what they mean by counterfeit people exactly. The article mentions deep fakes, and sources like OpenAI as examples but doesn't specify if all AI is “counterfeit people,” which is a term that if you look up only is seemingly only associated with the article. The sources are also quite random, a philosopher and historian who writes for the Economist is cited a few times but never says anything of substance outside of reiterating a similar fearful tone as the author. Honestly the article appears to be written itself by an AI. Some decent points are made, such as when it explains the endless issue of creating programs that learn to identify AI only to lead to AI that takes this information and learns to get around being detected as AI. The main solution in the eyes of the author is to have capital punishment be the crime for creating "Counterfeit People," but he is generally against this idea. Additionally this suggestion would require legislation in order to end the usage of AI, however the author has a distrust of authority as he believes AI will be used as a form of propoganda to convince individuals into agreeing with certain policies. Therefore the suggestion of government regulation would be inherently against the author's beliefs.
