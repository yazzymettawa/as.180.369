In the piece "The Problem With Counterfeit People," Daniel C. Dennett argues that "we must outlaw both the creation of counterfeit people and the 'passing along' of counterfeit people. The penalties for either offense should be extremely severe, given that civilization itself is at risk." However, Dennett's argument lacks conviction as it employs newly coined, poorly defined language as a scare tactic and proposes a solution to the real problems posed by Artificial Intelligence that contradicts Dennett’s stated philosophy and distrust of government.

Dennett supports his argument by providing historical context on the development of AI. From the inception of Alan Turing's Imitation Game, AI has successfully deceived people into interacting with it as though it were sentient or human-like. To reinforce the idea that people confuse AI with human behavior, Dennett argues that the rapid evolution of technology contributes to an increase in the number of "counterfeit people.”

The primary flaw in Dennett's argument is the lack of a clear definition for the term "counterfeit people." Although he provides examples such as deep fakes and sources like OpenAI, these represent vastly different aspects of AI. Without a clear definition, one could assume that "counterfeit people" refers to any technology that mimics human behavior. This vague terminology could be applied to all AI, rendering the term ineffective and serving only as a scare tactic, which undermines Dennett's argument. People are not interacting with OpenAI entirely unaware that it is non-human, so the type of AI Dennett warns about may not be the grave danger he suggests. The article fundamentally seeks to instill fear in the reader about the future of Artificial Intelligence through the use of this new term, "counterfeit people.”

The article also cites rather random sources, including a philosopher and historian who writes for The Economist. However, these sources offer little substance beyond echoing the author's fearful tone, further undermining Dennett's argument and turning the piece into fear-mongering rather than a genuine critique.

Some valid points are made, such as the ongoing challenge of creating programs that learn to identify AI, only for AI to adapt and evade detection. This poses significant issues for the future of copyright law, literary and artistic credit, and any medium where idea generation and proper attribution are crucial.

The author's main solution is capital punishment for creating "counterfeit people," although he appears to be generally against this idea. Additionally, this suggestion would require legislation to end the use of AI. However, the author expresses a distrust of authority, believing that AI will be used as propaganda to sway individuals into agreeing with certain policies. Therefore, the suggestion of government regulation contradicts the author's stated beliefs.
