Using these suggestions of what to include in a results section of a research paper what should I elaborate on: 
Your results section should do the following: 
Identify the results that answer your research question 
Identify and comment on any unusual or surprising or intriguing results 
Identify and comment on any results that you have told your reader you will comment on 
You may wish to begin your results section by reminding the reader of the question you are trying to answer and any caveats the reader should bear in mind. Note: It is not necessary or even desirable to comment in detail on every single result. 

RESULTS:
Returning to the research question: “How does the labor force participation rate from the 1976 until 2020 in the United States vary with political party governance?” the results suggest that there is little evidence to support a strong or reliable relationship between political party governance and labor force participation rates. This was found to be the case when observing both national political party governance (through the president's party affiliation and state labor force participation rates) as well on the state level (through the governor's party affiliation and state labor force participation rates)
While statistically insignificant the results indicated a slightly higher labor force participation rate during democratic leadership for both when the governor's party varied and when the president's party varied, but both were not significant.
